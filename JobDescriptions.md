### Job Descriptions

At Cockroach Labs, we want to ensure our job descriptions give you a clear picture of the role for which youâ€™re applying. Goals of our job descriptions:

1. Insight into the primary responsibilities of the role and the team with which you would be working.  
2. Give you an understanding of the experience you need to be successful in the role. 
3. Set clear expectations for your first three months.

We run each of our job descriptions through [Textio](https://textio.com/), a text analytics platform that helps us use language that is inclusive to all and helps you envision yourself working with us at Cockroach Labs. We try to make sure the tone of our job descriptions is neutral rather than masculine or feminine, to make sure that our job descriptions resound equally with candidates of all genders.  

We include an equal opportunity statement on our job description and hope that candidates choose to fill out the optional EEOC questionnaire. Asking these questions will help us discover any stages of our interview process that may be affecting certain groups of people, and with that data, we can ensure that our interview process is fair for candidates from all backgrounds.

While we may use specific job titles on our jobs page to help candidates find our open positions, internally, we standardize job titles to drive equality between people in a specific job function. For example, no matter whether you are an engineer working on our core, SQL, or admin UI engineering teams, your internal job title will be Member of Technical Staff. This system also allows our employees to focus more on what they need to do to achieve company, team, and personal goals, rather than focusing on what they need to do to get to the next job title.
