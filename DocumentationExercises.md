The following are exercises for technical writer positions.

## **Title:** **Technical Writer Information Design**

- **Overview:** You will be asked to explain a topic of your choice to the interviewer. The topic can be anything you’d like but make sure to pick a topic that you know a lot about - anything from how a database works to how dogs are trained to the work of a specific author. Before diving in, you should first learn how much the interviewer knows about the topic and keep their knowledge level in mind as you explain/teach the topic. The interviewer will ask for clarifications, context, and deeper explanations as necessary. You’ll have about 10 minutes to explain your topic. 

## **Title:** **Technical Writer Technical Competency and Documentation 1 & 2**

- **Overview:** For these exercises (each will be 75 minutes), the interviewer (member of the engineering team) will explain a technical concept to you. You will learn about the topic and then explain it back to the interviewer to ensure that you understand. For the next 35-40 minutes, you will be asked to document the topic. The interviewer will come back into the room after 40 minutes for a discussion. 

## **Title:** **Technical Writer Editing**

- **Overview:** As part of this exercise, we’ll share with you a draft of a raw piece of content. Your task is to edit it and present your revisions. You will be editing for clarity and readability, as well as identifying areas that could benefit from further detail, technical or otherwise. The edit does not have to be fact-perfect. This is a technical piece, and in the real world, you would have access to its author for clarifying questions. It does need to get across your vision for the piece and demonstrate your abilities as a writer and editor.
