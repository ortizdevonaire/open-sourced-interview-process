# Interview Feedback and Scoring

After an interview with a candidate, the interviewer will always leave feedback. The goal of collecting feedback is to answer the question, "Would I want this person on my team?" 

At Cockroach Labs, we use a 4 point scale:

- 4.0   Strong Hire - I feel strongly that this person will be successful in this role and am ready to present arguments as to why.

- 3.0   Hire - I am inclined toward believing this person will perform well in this role.

- 2.0   No Hire - I generally believe this candidate will perform poorly in this role but could be convinced otherwise.

- 1.0   Strong No Hire - I strongly believe the candidate will be a poor performer in this role. 

In the interview feedback, the interviewer is asked to include general impressions, a brief description on what they experienced during interviews, where the interviewer stands, and why they have this perspective.
